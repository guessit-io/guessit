# Contribute

GuessIt is under active development, and contributions are more than
welcome!

1.  Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion
    around a feature idea or a bug. There is a Contributor Friendly tag
    for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very familiar
    with the codebase yet.
2.  Fork [the repository][] on Github to start making your changes to
    the **master** branch (or branch off of it).
3.  Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature
    works as expected.
4.  Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and
    published. :)
